/*Descripition :  A sequence must be made with the following constraint on its values.
Constraint: The number of consecutive same elements in the sequence should be same as the value.  
Example: 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 is valid (input1)              
1 2 3 3 3  is invalid. (input2) 
Write a program that checks whether a given input sequence is valid.
Input format is just a sequence of integers.
Output format should be one of the following:
input1  : sequence is valid
input2  : sequence is not valid
*/

#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int input,digit,count = 0;
	printf("Enter the consecutive values"\n);
}
